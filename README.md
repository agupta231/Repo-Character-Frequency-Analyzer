# Character Frequency Analyzer

I'm buying a new keyboard, the [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/). One of
the reasons whhy I'm buying the keyboard, other than ergonomics, is due to 
its insane customiziblity. This script will analyze all of the code that I have
written to determine what characters I type the most often.

Once I have that data, I can create a keyboard that is designed for me, by me.

## Warning
Right now the program only has Gitlab support. This repository has been surpassed
by my [Keyboard Usage Analyzer](https://github.com/agupta231/Keyboard-Usage-Analyzer) repo, which
uses a keylogger to track all of your keyboard actions. Giving the repo Github support is really
straightforward (just some simple JSON parsing), but I don't have any need to add that
functionality.

If anybody would like to add it, open up a PR, and I'll accept it gladly!
